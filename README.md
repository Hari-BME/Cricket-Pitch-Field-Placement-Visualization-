# Cricket Pitch Visualizer with Streamlit
This project is a Streamlit web application that allows you to visualize a cricket pitch with various customization options.

## Description
This app provides an interactive way to visualize a cricket pitch, including:

Fielders' positions with labels (customizable)
Inner 30-yard circle
Pitch strip
Grease area
Stumps
Batsman
Selectable field angles
You can also customize the colors of various elements on the pitch, making it suitable for presentations or demonstrations.

Getting Started
This app is built using Python libraries Streamlit and Matplotlib.

Here's how to get started and run the app:

1.  Prerequisites:

Python 3.x (Make sure you have Python installed on your system. You can check the version by running python --version or python3 --version in your terminal)
pip (The package installer for Python. Usually comes bundled with Python)
2.  Installation:

Clone this repository using git:
Bash
git clone https://github.com/Hari-BME/Cricket-Pitch-Field-Placement-Visualization-.git
Use code with caution.

requirements.txt is a file included in this project that lists all the necessary Python libraries. Running the above command will install them automatically.

3.  Run the App:

Open a terminal or command prompt in the project directory.
Run the following command:
Bash
streamlit run app.py
Use code with caution.
This will launch the Streamlit app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501/.

Using the App
The app interface consists of two main sections:

1. Visualization:

This section displays the cricket pitch with various elements like fielders, pitch markings, stumps, and the batsman.

2. Customization Sidebar:

The sidebar allows you to customize the following aspects of the visualization:

Fielder Color: Select the color for the fielder markers.
Stump Color: Choose the color for the stumps.
Bat Color: Select the color for the bat.
Outfield Color: Choose the color for the outer field area.
Inner Circle Color: Select the color for the inner 30-yard circle.
User-defined Fielding Positions: You can define positions for up to 9 additional fielders by entering their names and X/Y coordinates on the pitch.
3. Saving Images:

The app allows you to save the customized visualization as an image. You can choose the format (PNG or JPEG), DPI (image resolution), and size (in inches) of the saved image.

Uploaded image preview
Sure, based on the information you provided, here is a detailed description of the image:

The image depicts a screenshot of a cricket pitch simulation created with Python libraries Streamlit and Matplotlib.

The cricket pitch itself is a green circle with a white boundary. It is surrounded by a thicker white circle with a red dashed line outside of it, representing the field boundary.

Here's a breakdown of the various elements visible on the cricket pitch:

Fielders: There are four blue circles representing fielders positioned on the pitch. The text labels near the circles indicate their positions, such as "Bowler" and "Keeper".
Inner Circle: A light green colored ellipse represents the inner 30-yard circle within the field.
Pitch Strip: A light brown rectangle depicts the bowling pitch located in the center of the cricket pitch.
Grease Area: Two small, light gray rectangles near the wickets represent the crease markings on the pitch.
Stumps: Three vertical red lines at each end of the pitch strip represent the wickets or stumps.
Batsman: A small brown rectangle positioned in front of the wickets represents the batsman.
On the top left corner of the image, there's text overlay  "Cricket Pitch Visualization".

There's also a faint watermark text "Hari-BME" in the center of the pitch, likely added as a creator signature or branding.

At the bottom of the image, there's a section  cut off but it likely represents options to customize the visualization and potentially save it as an image.

Cricket Pitch Visualizer with Streamlit: A Detailed Description
This Streamlit web application lets you create interactive visualizations of a cricket pitch, complete with various customization options to tailor it to your needs.

Key Features
Interactive Cricket Pitch: The app displays a detailed cricket pitch with the following elements:
Fielders with position labels (customizable)
Inner 30-yard circle marking
Pitch strip representation
Grease area markings
Stumps (bowling wickets)
Batsman standing at the crease
Field Angle Visualization (Concept): While not explicitly mentioned in the code you provided, the concept of visualizing field angles can potentially be incorporated. Imagine lines drawn from the bowler's position to various fielder positions, indicating their fielding angles.
Extensive Color Customization: Spice up your visualization by customizing the colors of various elements on the pitch. You can change the color of:
Fielders
Stumps
Bat
Outfield
Inner Circle
User-defined Fielder Positions: Want to see a specific fielding setup? The app allows you to define the positions of up to 9 additional fielders beyond the pre-defined ones. Simply enter their names and desired X/Y coordinates on the pitch.
Image Saving: Capture your customized visualizations! The app lets you save the current pitch view as an image. Choose the format (PNG or JPEG), image resolution (DPI), and size (in inches) for your saved image.
Benefits and Use Cases
This app offers a versatile tool for cricket enthusiasts, coaches, and analysts:

Visualization Aid: Get a clear visual representation of a cricket pitch layout, including field placements and key markings.
Customization for Presentations: Tailor the pitch visualization with specific team colors or highlight elements for presentations or demonstrations.
Interactive Experimentation: Try out different fielding setups and explore their potential effectiveness by visualizing field angles (concept).
Understanding Cricket Concepts: The app can be a helpful tool for learners to understand various cricket pitch elements and their significance.
Getting Started
The app is built using Python libraries Streamlit and Matplotlib. Here's a step-by-step guide to get started:

Prerequisites: Ensure you have Python 3.x and pip (package installer) installed on your system.

Installation:

Clone the project repository from GitHub using the provided link (replace with your actual repository URL).
Navigate to the project directory using the terminal.
Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install required libraries.
Run the App:

Open a terminal in the project directory.
Execute streamlit run app.py. This launches the app in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501/.
Using the App
The app interface consists of two main sections:

Visualization: This section displays the interactive cricket pitch with its elements.
